## Scars

After healing from high injury levels (or at a similar narratively appropriate moment) it might be good for a character to acquire a scar. This should not be used frequently, it should be for dramatic moments only.

Scars can range from a small as losing a digit, to burns coving half a persons body. Whatever the scar is though, it should be impactful.

When gaining a scar, a player must decrease an ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 2 to represent how the scar has changed them. For example, if someone lost an eye, they might take from perception but give to intelligence.
