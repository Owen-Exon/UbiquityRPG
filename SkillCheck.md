# Skill Check

When a player performs a skill check the DM first tells that player what two skills are to be used and what the difficulty is. The player then rolls those two dice and applies any relivenet modifiers. If both dice equal or exceed the difficulty the player achieves a full success (also known as a "pass"). If one dice is lower than the difficulty the player achieve a partial success (often shortened to just a "partial"). Finally, if neither dice reaches the difficulty, the player has a full failure. If a dice rolls a 1, that dice automatically fails regardless of modifiers.

## Options

Not all skill checks will use exactly two skills. It may be nice to give players a choice of pairs. For example, when climbing a ladder Dexterity-Strength could be rolled or Agility-Agility.

## Impossible Successes

Due to the use of different dice for different skills, situations can arise where a check is impossible to fully succeed on, this is by design as if a character is really not good enough at something, it makes sense that if it was difficult enough they would never be able to succeed.

## Attacks

When rolling an attack a player rolls the player rolls a skill and a proficiency dice. This skill is determined by what kind of weapon they are using. Usually it will be strength for melee weapons like swords and axes and dexterity for ranged weapons like bows and slingshots but there may be exceptions. The proficiency dice is determined by how familiar and well trained a character is with that type of weapon. For example someone may be an expert with longbow and decent with a shortbow but never used a slingshot.

Proficiency dice a worked out as follows:

| Proficiency | Dice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Novice | d2 | Never used a similar weapon. Not recommended for most campaigns. |
| Apprentice | d4 | Has had little training or using an unfamiliar weapon similar to one used before (eg. longbow / shortbow)|
| Adept | d6 | Has had training and used for some adventuring. Most weapons used should be this level. |
| Expert | d8 | Has trained for years and become familiar over the course of many adventures. Should be used for a characters main weapon. |
| Master | d10 | The best of the best. Not recommended for most campaigns. |
