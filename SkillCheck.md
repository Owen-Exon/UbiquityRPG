# Skill Check

When a player performs a skill check the DM tells that player what two skills are to be used and what the difficulty is. The player  rolls those and applies modifiers. If both dice equal or exceed the difficulty the player achieves a full success ("Success" or "Pass"). If one dice is lower than the difficulty the player achieve a partial success ("Partial"). Finally, if neither dice reaches the difficulty, the player has a full failure. ("Fail") If a dice rolls a 1, that dice automatically fails regardless of modifiers.

## Options

Not all skill checks will be clear on what two skills to use. It may be nice to give players a choice of pairs. For example, when climbing a cliff face Dexterity-Strength could be rolled but you could instead roll Agility-Agility.

## Impossible Successes

Due to the use of different dice for different skills, situations can arise where a check is impossible to fully succeed on, this is by design as if a character is really not good enough at something, it makes sense that if it was difficult enough they would never be able to succeed.

## Attacks

When rolling an attack a player rolls the player rolls a skill and a proficiency dice. This skill is determined by what kind of weapon they are using. Usually it will be strength for melee weapons and dexterity for ranged weapons but there may be exceptions. The proficiency dice is determined by how familiar and well trained a character is with that type of weapon. For example someone may be an expert with longbow and decent with a shortbow but never used a slingshot.

Proficiency dice a worked out as follows:

| Proficiency | Dice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Novice | d2 | Never used a similar weapon. Not recommended for most campaigns. |
| Apprentice | d4 | Has had little training or using an unfamiliar weapon similar to one used before (eg. longbow / shortbow)|
| Adept | d6 | Has had training and used for some adventuring. Most weapons used should be this level. |
| Expert | d8 | Has trained for years and become familiar over the course of many adventures. Should be used for a characters main weapon. |
| Master | d10 | The best of the best. Not recommended for most campaigns. |

## Rolling with Advantage, Disadvantage and Consequence

### Advantage

You can pick one dice to roll twice and pick the higher number.

### Disadvantage

You must roll the higher dice twice and pick the lower number.

### Consequence

Pick one of the two dice to roll. This is either a pass or fail, no partials.
