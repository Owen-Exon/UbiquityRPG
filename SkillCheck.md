# Skill Check

When a player performs a skill check the DM first tells that player what two skills are to be used and what the difficulty is. The player then rolls those two dice and applies any relivenet modifiers. If both dice equal or exceed the difficulty the player achieves a full success (also known as a "pass"). If one dice is lower than the difficulty the player achieve a partial success (often shortened to just a "partial"). Finally, if neither dice reaches the difficulty, the player has a full failure. If a dice rolls a 1, that dice automatically fails regardless of modifiers.

## Options

Not all skill checks will use exactly two skills. It may be nice to give players a choice of pairs. For example, when climbing a ladder Dexterity-Strength could be rolled or Agility-Agility.

## Impossible Successes

Due to the use of different dice for different skills, situations can arise where a check is impossible to fully succeed on, this is by design as if a character is really not good enough at something, it makes sense that if it was difficult enough they would never be able to succeed.
